            <p>
                A touchstone for the classical riding theory is the one must always be able to ride a highly trained horse like a remonte. ('Remonte' is a German term signifying a young, unbroken horse).
            </p>
            <p>
                With the demand that the horse progressing in training should become more and more beautiful, we combine the principle that even the advanced horse must be able to resume the suppleness and posture of the young remonte at any moment on demand.
            </p>
            <p>
                Only this point of view prevents the rider from letting the highest collection degenerate into cramps.
            </p>
            <p>
                If an advanced (S) level horse can embody the remonte type at every moment, then it has the correct dressage basis.
            </p>
            <p>
                This, however, can only be recognised by the dressage judge who has fully penetrated the essence of the relationships in dressage training and sees through what is shown to him." (Colonel (ret.) Felix Bürkner, Sankt Georg Almanach 1953, p. 63, 1953)
            </p>
            <p style="padding-top: 25px;">
                To correct a horse, you always have to go back to the basics.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first is that the horse walks without fear and compulsion. In the flight animal, compulsion and fear often manifest themselves in hurried walking.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a rider, we first have to act as a weight that is as comfortable as possible, as the aids are not yet understood by the horse anyway and would only disturb it.
            </p>
            <p>
                A horse needs its four legs and neck to balance itself. Any shortening of the neck through rein action robs it of its balance.
            </p>
            <p>
                "The young (raw) horse must be given time to find its balance under the rider. Any premature intervention with the reins creates difficulties for the horse, which later have to be painstakingly removed." Seeger (Albrecht Kurt: Reiter-Wissen, p. 50,Franckh-Kosmos)
            </p>

                    "Riding forwards, straightening the horse on the long reins and not starting too early to put the horse in hand (bridling).
                </p>
                <p>
                    From the very beginning it is important that the horse first learns to accept the forward aids willingly and to regain its natural balance under the weight of the rider in movement, regardless of posture and position." (Wätjen, Reitkunst in Wort und Bild, p. 17, 1953)
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Therefore the horse must be trotted forwards evenly, almost without reins, until it becomes a little tired, as a result of which it no longer tenses up, makes calm, even steps and finds its support on its four legs - that is its balance. Here the horse drops its nose." (S.v.Haugk,Die Bearbeitung junger Pferde mit der Trense, Von einem alten Reiter, 1944, Kesselringsche Verlagsbuchhandlung, p.13)
                </p>
                <p style="padding-top: 25px;">
                    "How can the natural balance that has been lost due to the strain on the rider be regained? First of all, through a steady seat and the greatest possible passivity on the part of the rider, especially his hands. A lot of aids, which the horse doesn't even recognise, only interfere.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If sufficient attention is paid to this, the young horse will carry his neck and head in the way that is most comfortable for him and most appropriate to his conformation. This, as it were, self-assumed position of the remonte's neck and head will (as anyone who has had to train remonts several times knows) be a low one in most cases, given the aforementioned passivity of the rider. (...) This will cause the horse's nose to droop even more; the horse, which is not forced by the rider, lets go and especially gives up the tension in the back, as a result of which the naturally spacious and slow gaits become more and more apparent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The aforementioned, naturally slow gaits are best demonstrated in a moderate trot, which, as will be mentioned later, we can call the "natural trotting tempo". The same (...) forms the main basis of the dressage system. The movement of the horse comes from the impulsion of the hind legs. Raw horses generally move forwards with their front feet more than they push with their hind feet. Most of the power lies on the forehand and the raised front foot must be put down quickly to support it. The muscles, ligaments and joints of the hindquarters are therefore found to be slack and stiff.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This already shows how detrimental it would be for the young horse if one wanted to lift it up high and make heavy use of its weak hindquarters. " (Troschke, E. Freiherr von: Der Gang der Dressur des Remontepferdes, p. 29, 1997)

                    The rider must be able to wait until the horse finds its balance and until it puts its nose forward and seeks the rider's hand of its own accord without getting its nose behind the vertical.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The horse, which was once a licensed stallion and successful at competitions, had so little balance that he could not be ridden without reins. This is a sign of a lack of balance, but also that the horse was not ridden and turned primarily with the seat, but with the reins. In order to check and correct this, it makes sense to always ride with the reins without contact and one-handed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is also interesting to compare the horse's facial expression in the videos. While in the first video the ears are only back and the horse appears submissive and stressed, in the second video it is interested, pricks up its ears and dares to change its position. It is not forced into a posture, but the rider waits without disturbing the horse until it finds its balance again and again.

                    In Conclusion, whether training a young, untouched horse or rehabbing a horse with issues around contact and balance, you must take the time to understand what works for each horse physically, mentally and emotionally.

                    Good horsemanship means first listening to and understanding your horse!
